Subject: Submission: Virtual Membership Card Mobile Application - [Your Name]

Dear [Hiring Manager Name or Team],

I am pleased to submit my assignment for the Mobile Developer (Flutter / React Native) position, focusing on the development of a "Virtual Membership Card" mobile application.

This project demonstrates my ability to create a visually appealing and functional mobile application with dynamic QR code generation and state management, aligning with the scenario and requirements provided.

**Project Highlights:**

*   **Tech Stack**: Developed using React Native, showcasing proficiency in modern mobile development frameworks.
*   **UI Design**: Implemented a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing card layout, including static text for user name ("Alex Ray"), membership level ("Platinum Member"), and a designated placeholder for a profile picture.
*   **Dynamic QR Code Generation**: Integrated `react-native-qrcode-svg` to dynamically generate QR codes based on a predefined user ID string. The QR code is not a static image.
*   **"Refresh QR Code" Button**: Implemented functionality to dynamically update the QR code by appending a current timestamp to the user ID string, simulating a time-sensitive token for enhanced security.
*   **State Management**: Demonstrated accurate handling of state changes to ensure the QR code updates seamlessly upon button interaction.

**Access to the Project:**

I have prepared a comprehensive GitHub repository containing the complete project code, documentation, and a demonstration of the application's functionality. You can access it here:

**GitHub Repository Link:** [Insert your GitHub Repository Link Here]

*(Please note: I have included demo screenshots in the README.md to illustrate the QR code refresh functionality, as video generation requires a subscription upgrade.)*

**Web Demo (for quick review):**

For a quick review of the application's core functionality in a web browser, I have also provided a static HTML demo. You can access it by opening the `index.html` file located in the project root, or by deploying it to a static hosting service. Instructions for self-deployment are included in the `deployment_instructions.md` file within the project.

I am confident that this submission effectively showcases my mobile UI skills, library integration capabilities, and understanding of state management in a mobile application context. I am eager to discuss my approach and the project in more detail.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
